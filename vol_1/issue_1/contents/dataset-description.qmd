# About the Spotify Dataset

The dataset [^1_1] contains the most popular songs on Spotify as of 2023 [^1_2].

The toplist contains tracks regardless to their release year, and popularity of a song is measured in the total number of streams it has accumulated by the time of the data extraction.

A single observation includes information about the _title_ of the song, the _count_ and _names_ of the _involved artists_, _release date_, and count of _streams_. Whether the given song takes place in a curated _playlist_ or _chart_ of Spotify, Apple, Deezer, or Shazam, and if so how many of them, is also indicated for each observation.

Besides these, there are some technical details provided for each song like _bpm_, _danceability_, or _liveness_ to name a few.
