# About the Spotify Dataset

The dataset [^1] contains the most popular songs on Spotify as of the end of 2023.

The toplist contains tracks regardless to their release year, and popularity of a song is measured in the total number of streams it has accumulated by the time of the data extraction.

A single observation includes information about the title of the song, the count and names of the involved artists, release date, and streams. Whether the given song takes place in a curated playlist or chart of Spotify, Apple, Deezer, or Shazam (only chart info), and if so how many of them, is also indicated for each observation.

Besides these, there are some technical details provided for each song like bpm, danceability, or liveness to name a few.
